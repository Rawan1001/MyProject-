# EDA Project- 
In this project the task is to use the MTA turnstile Data to help a non-profit organization
called ‘The kids are the future’, hand out an event flyer to the summer charity event that they 
are throwing for children with cancer. The organization expect to achieve these goals:

- Getting enough exposure to advertise for the event and the organization work. 
- Target the high-to-medium-income commuters of the subway in New York city.

# The plan in the project is to find:
- What the stations that have a lot of commuters during the morning/noon
period. To determine what are the best places that volunteers can be assigned 
at to distribute the event flyer and advertise for the charity work.
- The stations where people are more likely to donate or attend the event due to economic status.

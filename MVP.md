For the project the plan was to get the busiest stations in the city of New York and compare it 
with the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city.
- The data is cleaned from negative entries.
- Added a new column with the day of week that correspond to the date.
- Get the busiest stations and plot it in a bar chart diagram
